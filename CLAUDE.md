# Kitchen Terminal K7

Retro-futurist kitchen dashboard running as a PWA kiosk on an old iPad
(Safari 15 baseline, iPad Air 2 / A8X / 2GB), with a Node/TypeScript backend on a
physical machine in the home LAN.

**Language note:** the project's foundation documents are written in Polish.
Keep them in Polish when editing; code, identifiers and commit messages are English.

## Where things are

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `docs/handoff/HANDOFF.md` | context, decision log, deferred ideas — read this first |
| `docs/handoff/PLAN.md` | phased plan (Faza 0–6) with per-task model assignments |
| `docs/handoff/TECH-STACK.md` | stack choices, own/3rd-party libraries, open caveats |
| `docs/handoff/layout.schema.yaml` | the layout contract — 14 card types, recursive containers |
| `docs/handoff/theme.schema.yaml` | the theme contract — every design token the app may use |
| `docs/handoff/retro-scifi.yaml` | the default theme instance |
| `docs/handoff/layout.example.yaml` | worked example of a full layout |
| `docs/handoff/*.html` | standalone wireframes (open directly in a browser) |
| `design-system/` | the built design system — `DESIGN.md` is normative prose, `kitchen-terminal-k7-kit.html` is the normative component spec, `tokens.css` is the only place a colour is defined |
| `docs/icons/` | logo assets + usage notes |
| `context/` | graph-workflow lifecycle files — see `context/README.md` |

## Standing constraints

- **Theming is an architectural rule, not a preference.** Components read *only*
  CSS custom properties generated from the theme file. No component ever hardcodes
  a colour, font, radius, border width or shadow. Swapping the whole design must be
  a matter of pointing `layout.yaml`'s `theme:` at a different file.
- **Safari 15 is the compile target.** iPad Air 2 and iPhone 6s both cap at
  iOS/iPadOS 15, so that is the shared baseline for `tsconfig` and Vite `build.target`.
  Verify on the real device early and often — do not assume modern JS/CSS lands.
- **Secrets never reach the frontend.** The Google refresh token and the Kilo Gateway
  key live server-side only. Varlock manages `.env` by schema; agents see the schema,
  never the values. Secrets must not leak into GlitchTip payloads alongside errors.
- **`ConversationService` stays decoupled from the chat endpoint** so the chat can
  later be driven by MCP or a dedicated skill instead of the HTTP route.

## graph-workflow — change lifecycle with graph memory

This project uses the graph-workflow: the 10x change lifecycle fused with the
agentic-memory-system graph. One lifecycle, not two workflows — memory operations are
steps inside it.

**Reaching the memory surface.** Prefer the `agentic-memory` MCP tools when this
session has them. When it does not — a fresh clone, an unapproved `.mcp.json`, a
config that landed mid-session — use the CLI, which needs no registration:
`agentic-memory --help` (same operations; `capture -` reads the body from stdin so
prose never goes through shell quoting). It is installed on PATH and always acts on
the project you are standing in, so it needs no path argument. Never skip a memory
step because the MCP tools are absent.

```
/gw-new → worktree → /gw-research → /gw-plan → /gw-plan-review → /gw-implement | /gw-goal → /gw-review → merge → /gw-archive
```

### Task router

| Situation | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| A question, no change open ("how does X work?", triage, onboarding) | `/gw-ask` (recall-only, foundation scope, journals usage, captures nothing) |
| Foundation docs written or amended (PRD, tech-stack, ADRs) | `/gw-foundation` (distill into lifetime-tier candidates) |
| The project's language is unmodelled, or a change opens new domain territory | `/gw-domain` (domain entities: greenfield elicitation or brownfield extraction; human ratifies) |
| "What should we build next" / roadmap time / an epic just closed | `/gw-ideate` (mine the graph's issues, gaps and blind spots for evidence-backed opportunities) |
| Starting any unit of work | `/gw-new` (folder + Goal node + seed recall — always first) |
| Territory unknown | `/gw-research` (recall first, explore the gap, capture findings) |
| A goal too big for one change — spans subsystems, >5 phases, reads like a product | `/gw-slice` (tracer-bullet breakdown → the human rules on granularity and order → the epic registry in `roadmap.md`; opens only the first slice) |
| A plan or design that should be argued with before it is committed to | `/gw-grill` (one question per turn, each with a recommendation; `impact_of` on every load-bearing claim; contradictions captured and left for a human) |
| Someone wants to *understand* part of this system, not change it | `/gw-teach` (the graph as curriculum: prerequisites in `DEPENDS_ON` order, the frontier from the journal, every claim cited). One question only → `/gw-ask` |
| Notes or a conversation that should become a PRD | `/gw-foundation` — writes `context/foundation/prd.md` when there is none (synthesising, never interviewing), then distils it into the graph. Wanting to be *interrogated* about it instead is `/gw-grill` |
| A UI surface to build or redesign | `/gw-wireframe` (screen inventory → one screen per turn with the user → build decisions; obeys the design system) |
| A screen that has to be *seen* before it is built | `/gw-prototype` (the agreed deck → clickable HTML in the project's real tokens, served by pmview; refuses any screen with an unruled component gap) |
| Someone asks for `impeccable shape` on a gw project | `/gw-wireframe` instead — same job, but grounded in the domain model and the graph. Use impeccable for the *visual* pass, after the structure is agreed |
| Ready to design the work | `/gw-plan` (recall + impact_of + plan.md + plan-boundary capture) |
| Plan written, before implementation | `/gw-plan-review` (fresh session, independent recall, plan vs settled constraints) |
| Multi-phase / needs judgment | `/gw-implement` (interactive, per-phase memory loop, human gates) |
| A bug, a regression, or a behaviour-preserving refactor | `/gw-fix` (TDD: red before any source edit, minimal green, then refactor — a full change increment) |
| Bounded, verifiable by command | `/gw-goal` or `claude -p` (headless; humans at PR only) |
| Change reaches PR | `/gw-review` (code review + memory human gate) |
| Merged | `/gw-archive` (final capture, deactivate+sweep, folder → archive) |
| An issue tracker is in use (GitHub Issues, Linear, Jira) | `/gw-track` (adopt-or-create the item, push phases/status at gates, pull acceptance criteria, report divergence) |
| Disputes/promotions accumulated, human present | `/gw-resolve` (joint queue session: agent presents+recommends, human rules, applied via guided GUI API) |
| Several changes archived; recall keeps returning near-duplicates | `/gw-consolidate` (cross-change recurrence → one abstraction, drafted by you, committed by the human) |

### Standing rules (apply to every session)

- **Recall before deciding.** At task start and before touching an unloaded
  subsystem: `recall_context(query=..., goal_ref=<memory_goal from change.md>)`.
  Keep the `[node:<id>]` handles — they are write-back ids.
- **Goal-mandatory writes.** No `memory_goal` in change.md → run /gw-new's scope
  steps before capturing anything.
- **Capture residue, not narration** — decisions, constraints, issues, concepts,
  invariants; one statement per artifact, readable cold, with edges.
- **The three-part test decides *whether*.** Capture only when all three hold:
  (1) **hard to reverse** — changing your mind later has a real cost;
  (2) **surprising without context** — a future reader will ask "why did they do
  it this way?"; (3) **the result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine
  alternatives and one was picked for stated reasons. Any one missing and it is
  conversation, not knowledge. A graph full of restated obviousness ranks *worse*
  than a small one, because every recall then serves the obvious thing alongside
  the load-bearing one, and retrieval is deterministic — nothing downstream
  rescues a bad capture.
- **Speak the graph's vocabulary.** List the controlled facet vocabulary before
  the session's first capture (MCP vocabulary read if available, else GUI or the
  committed dump); query recalls with the graph's own terms, not paraphrases.
- **Speak the domain's vocabulary too.** `domain_model()` once per session, before
  naming anything in code, tests, plans, or UI copy. Use the ratified entity names;
  a term the model lacks is a `/gw-domain` proposal, not a word you coin. Attach
  every capture to the entities it concerns with `ABOUT` edges — that wiring is what
  makes an entity a hub instead of a dictionary entry.
- **Names are not claims.** A thing the project refers to (`Invoice`, `Customer`)
  is a domain entity via `capture_entity`, not an artifact. The test: can you
  disagree with it? Entities never decay and survive every sweep, so a careless one
  outlives every change that could have corrected it — and only a human ratifies.
- **Navigate code through the graphify MCP** when the project has a code
  knowledge graph (`graphify-out/` present) — graph queries for architecture and
  file relationships first; raw grep/read is the fallback, not the default.
- **Journal every session** — one batched `append_events`
  (USED/CONFIRMED/CONTRADICTED/REVIEWED/NOTED) before ending. Honest events only.
- **Contradictions are recorded, never resolved** — CONTRADICTS edges and
  CONTRADICTED events flag for human review; that is the system working.
- **Four surfaces, four jobs.** `context/design/` holds what a screen is supposed
  to look like (the deck, the prototypes, the ask log — surface-keyed, so it
  outlives the changes that touch it). `context/changes/` holds lifecycle state, the
  graph holds knowledge, the tracker holds work state. A decision recorded only in
  an issue comment is a decision no future recall will serve — knowledge goes in the
  graph, always, and the issue gets a pointer at most.
- **Never** mutate trust, clear flags, promote tiers, archive nodes, ratify a
  domain entity, or commit a consolidation. Not possible via the agent surface; do
  not work around it. You may propose, detect, draft, and recommend — every one of
  those ends at a human.
- **Degraded mode (store genuinely unreachable): queue, don't skip.** Try the CLI
  transport first — "the MCP tools aren't registered" is not a degraded mode, it is
  the other door. If the *store itself* is unreachable, append every
  would-be operation to `context/changes/<id>/memory-backlog.md` — create_change
  parameters, captures (content, type, edges, facets), events, promotion
  candidates — and replay them when the surface returns. Gates consume the
  backlog as the stand-in graph. The discipline never pauses; only the store does.
- **`context/archive/` is immutable.** If a resolved target path starts with
  `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change
  with /gw-new."

### Paths

- `context/changes/<change-id>/` — active change: change.md (incl. `memory_goal`),
  plan.md, research.md. Thin lifecycle files only; knowledge lives in the graph.
  `change.md` also carries `design_surface: <slug>` (repeatable) when the change
  touches a UI surface — that is what makes `/gw-review` Part 1b fire.
- `context/design/<surface>/` — keyed by **surface**, not by change, so a screen's
  design outlives the changes that touch it. `deck.json` (the agreed screen
  inventory and wireframe geometry), `screens/*.html` (clickable prototypes in the
  project's real tokens), `asks.jsonl` (the append-only agent↔human desk). All
  committed. **Not** a per-change folder, and never moved by `/gw-archive`.
- `context/archive/<change-id>/` — immutable, append-only.
- `context/foundation/` — PRD, roadmap, tech-stack: human source of truth, whose
  normative content is mirrored into the graph at lifetime tier via
  `/gw-foundation` (foundation.md carries that scope's `memory_goal`).
  `roadmap.md` doubles as the **epic registry**: epic-sized goals are sliced
  there into ordered change-ids; slices carry `epic: <id>` in change.md, the
  epic id as a capture facet, and sibling slices' surviving nodes as
  parent_refs. One change = one plan, one review sitting — epics are grouped,
  never merged into one change.
- `context/memory-graph.dump` — the tracked store, as legible text (diffs and
  merges natively). `context/memory-graph.db` is a gitignored build artifact the
  store rebuilds on open and refreshes on close; nothing to set up, no filter.
  If a merge conflicts in the dump, run `agentic-memory sync resolve` and `git add`
  the result — never hand-edit the markers out, because git aligns similar blocks and
  shows only their differing lines, so "keep both sides" can splice half of one entry
  onto half of another. Memory commands refuse to run against a conflicted dump, so
  you will be told rather than served a half-loaded graph.
- `context/foundation/tracker.md` — the issue-tracker binding (which tracker, the
  board's real state names, who may close). `tracker: none` is a valid answer.
- `context/changes/<id>/change.md` carries `tracker:` alongside `memory_goal:` when
  a tracker is bound.
